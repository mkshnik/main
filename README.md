To launch application you have to: 
1. Open application folder in terminal 
2. Write `python snake_game.py` 
3. In case of error make sure you have all dependencies 

Now the game is on. \
Here are some game rules, if you are really don't know how to play snake... \
You're a hungry snake that needs to be fed. \
You have to catch randomly spawned food by controling your \
snake using arrow-keys or `A`, `W`, `S`, `D`.\
 You can't change direction to opposite of the current one. \
Pay attention not to bump into your own body, in that case game will be \
over and you will need to start a new one by pressing `Space`
   
Is suicide the only way? \
Of course not. You can beat the game by scoring 453 pieces of food. \
And after you can start from 0 by pressing `Space`. \
Oh yeah, forgot to mention, you get +1 point each time you feed your snake.
